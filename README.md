# basic-quiz-server-spring-boot

To run this site run the command ./mvnw spring-boot:run then access the site localhost:8080
In this lab I asked copilot to make a simple quiz site that uses thymeleaf with spring boot. 
It created most of the code and i worked within the Homecontroller to get it so the quiz is the splashpage and so that the site would properly transfer and generate new questions when clicking submit. I then asked copilot to generate some edge test cases and assured that those worked.
